# Micrograd-PLUS

A **minimal autograd engine and neural network library in Python**, implemented from scratch and inspired by Andrej Karpathy’s "micrograd" lecture.

While this project follows the core concepts presented in the lecture, several features have been independently added to extend functionality and usability, including:

- Multiple **activation functions**: ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh  
- Modular **MLP, Layer, and Neuron classes**  
- **Loss functions**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cross-Entropy  
- **Optimizer**: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)  
- Examples for **simple regression and classification**

This project was built as a **learning-focused exercise**, demonstrating a deep understanding of backpropagation, computational graphs, and neural network training while providing a **reusable framework** for small experiments and custom extensions.
